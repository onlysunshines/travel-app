# Travel App Project

## Overview
This project allows the user to check the weather to make an informed decision about their next travel destination! 

## Under the Hood
I am using webpack to compile the code in a scalable way to make it easier to grow the application.  Jest tests to make sure things are working as intended and Service Workers so that the app has offline capabilities.

## API Dependencies
Pixabay, Geonames, Weatherbit and OpenMeteo
